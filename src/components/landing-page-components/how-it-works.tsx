            <div>
              Each property undergoes rigorous due diligence, including legal
              and regulatory compliance checks. Verified documentation is
              attached to each token’s metadata and accessible on the token’s
              detail page.

            <div>Asset Valuation</div>
            <div>
              Asset value is determined using industry-standard real estate
              appraisal methodologies, enhanced by proprietary survey and data
              analysis tools. This valuation informs the token’s backing ratio
              and total supply issuance.

            <div>On-Chain Registration</div>
            <div>
              Once verified, asset data is recorded in our off-chain registry
              and immutably logged on the blockchain. This ensures transparent
              provenance and auditable proof-of-ownership.

            <div>Token Generation</div>
            <div>
              Upon successful registration, the system programmatically mints
              tokens representing fractionalized economic rights to the
              underlying asset. These tokens are cryptographically linked to the
              verified property metadata.

            <div>
              Tokens are listed on our decentralized marketplace and become
              available for trading. Users can hold, stake, exchange, or sell
              tokens through both the marketplace and integrated peer-to-peer
              escrow systems, enabling liquidity and value realization.
